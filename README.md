# AI-agents

This is the place where i store and share all my wonderful AI agents.


## PageAnalyzer
The pageAnalyzer agent works with OpenAI python agent SDK.

To use the agents you can give it a brief detailed description of everything noticable on the site, it'll analyze what things are possibly vulenerable.

## commandHelper
The commandhelper works by giving it a consise decription of a single or serie of commands. It will then think which commands are needed and the agent will perform those actions.

## smartPentestRecon
The smartPentestRecon agent will analyze the site using a custom nmap, nikto and wp scans. Finally it will give you a rapport with interesting points.
